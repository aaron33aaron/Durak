================  USER GUIDE TO DURAK  ============== 
This is our guide for our program for the card game Durak.
Durak is a Russian card game and the goal of the game is to
get rid of all of your cards before your opponent.The player 
that is left with no cards is the winner and the other is the 
Durak or 'fool' in english terms.Currently our game is played 
between the user and an AI player.After clicking start you and 
your opponent will be dealt a hand of six cards.The size of the 
deck is thirty six cards and this is the deck that will be drawn 
from when players shed a card.Trump cards will become visible to 
the user and AI player that determine which suit types trump all 
other base suits.The player that begins the attack will be determined 
by the player will the lowest trump card value.After each round, players 
will draw from the deck till they reach their six card limit until 
the thirty six card deck is exhausted.To play a card you can will 
select your desired card.When you are attacking you can start by playing
any card in your deck, the computer will defend with any card of the same
suit and higher value or with a trump card. A trump card is displayed in
the game form and determines what suit beats all other suits meaning you can 
play it on any suit. After the computer succesfuly defends you can counter
with a card of the same rank/value or with a trump card. This will continue
until one player can't play anymore, cease's their attack or pick's up the cards.
Ceasing your attack will end the play and give the attack over to the opposition 
while taking a card will pick up the cards from the play deck. You will continue
to attack and defend until all thirty six cards have been dealt and then the first
player left with no cards is the winner and will be annouced at the end of the game.
